Todo:

- Implement spectral pitch-shifting properly
x Speed up windowing computation by using a lookup table
- Finish the phase vocoder! What happens when you use the phases
  of some auxiliary signal but the amplitudes of yours?
  Can we get Bon Iver-style harmonizer sounds?
  	- That ought to be the phases of the audio input signal, and the
  	  amplitudes of some auxiliary signal, i.e. a synth. It might seem
  	  . 
- Spectral freeze
	- All sorts of interesting things here: a sustain pedal for example,
	  ... lots to think about
